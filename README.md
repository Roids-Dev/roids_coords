# roids_coords
 Puts your coords and heading on screen

# How to use
- Add `roids_coords` to your resources folder
- while the script is started use `/showcoords` to enable/disable the coords

- It's probably best you don't keep this started on your server at all times. Only start it when you need it so you don't run into any issues.
